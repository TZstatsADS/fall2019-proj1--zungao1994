## *Summary*
Music can be the creature of the anges. The development of songs had proceeded steadily since different enviornment in different time peroids.

The whole dataset: "lyrics.csv" is a filtered corpus of 100,000+ song lyrics from MetroLyrics. Available features are song name, year, artist, genre, and lyrics. You can find the complete 380,000+ song lyrics data on Kaggle. A lyrics.RData file is also provided in the $'\data'$ folder.

### Envioenmental settings
This report is prepared with the following environmental settings.
```{r}
print(R.version)
```
First,I process the raw textual data ‘lyrics.csv’ saved in $ data $ file by cleaning data, removing stopwords and creating a tidy version of texts which is saved in $ output $ file for this report.

```{r}
load("processed_lyrics.RData")
```
## *Genre of songs in different time*: Different time peroids influence Genre of Music?
From 1970 to 2019, Rock and Pop are the main thems of types of songs. Also, given any specific peroids (e.g 2000 - 2010), Rock(Top 1) and POP(Top2) are still the most popular music genre.

### Graphs of Top5 popular music Genre in five time peroids
From these graphs, we can see that Rock and POP always take the 1st and 2nd position of the songs' genres. 

During 1970-1990, Jazz was at the 3rd position. However, after 1990, proportion of Hiphop and Metal is increasing dramatically which means more and more people were accepting these trypes of music, and the proportion of jazz start decreasing.

```
Jazz's position decreases through time passes, and more and more Hippop and metal song appeared. Some reasons may explain this situation.

- 1, Young people prefer Metal and Hippop than Jazz because they think they are cooler than "classic" jazz, and jazz music should belong to their parents.

- 2, Different living pace in different time peroid can also decide people's preference of music. Current life pace is much faster than before which means people do not have enough time to enjoy jazz, but need music like hiphop and metal to release their pressure.

- 3, Especially, in 2000-2010, hiphop and metal incresease dramatically. During 2000-2010, a lot of big events happened. 2000 internet bubble, 911, iraq war,2008 financial depression and so on happened in this peroid. Thus, I have a question that whether the Songs types have relationship with economics situations (e.g GDP, wars,depression)?

## *Sentiment of songs in different time*: Does Sentiment of songs have relationship with GDP Growth in different time peroid?
In previous part, I have a guess that whether a song can reflect economics situations (e.g GDP, wars,depression)? Here, I would use package $"sentimentr"$ to calculate the sentiment score of songs in five different peroid 1970-1980, 1980-1990,1990-2000,2000-2010,2010-2019, and compare these scores with avergae GDP Growth of these peroids. (GDP Growth data is collected form google, just 5 data points)

Sentimentr is designed to quickly calculate text polarity sentiment at the sentence level and optionally aggregate by rows or grouping variable(s). If the score is larger than 0, then it means that the songs' lyrics is positive (happy, positive, good); if the score is less than 0, then it means that the songs' lyrics is negative (sad, negative, bad). We will collect all lyrics of each time peroid, conbine them together, and calculate a sentiment score for each peorid.


```{r}

library("sentimentr")
song_1970_1980 = dt_lyrics$year >= 1970 & dt_lyrics$year < 1980
song_1980_1990 = dt_lyrics$year >= 1980 & dt_lyrics$year < 1990
song_1990_2000 = dt_lyrics$year >= 1990 & dt_lyrics$year < 2000
song_2000_2010 = dt_lyrics$year >= 2000 & dt_lyrics$year < 2010
song_2010_2020 = dt_lyrics$year >= 2010 & dt_lyrics$year < 2020

Sentiment_score = c()
sentence = get_sentences(dt_lyrics$stemmedwords[song_1970_1980], fix_curly_quotes = TRUE, as_vector = TRUE)
Sentiment_score = c(Sentiment_score, sum(sentiment_by(sentence, by = NULL)$"ave_sentiment") / sum(song_1970_1980))
sentence = get_sentences(dt_lyrics$stemmedwords[song_1980_1990], fix_curly_quotes = TRUE, as_vector = TRUE)
Sentiment_score = c(Sentiment_score, sum(sentiment_by(sentence, by = NULL)$"ave_sentiment") / sum(song_1980_1990))
sentence = get_sentences(dt_lyrics$stemmedwords[song_1990_2000], fix_curly_quotes = TRUE, as_vector = TRUE)
Sentiment_score = c(Sentiment_score, sum(sentiment_by(sentence, by = NULL)$"ave_sentiment") / sum(song_1990_2000))
sentence = get_sentences(dt_lyrics$stemmedwords[song_2000_2010], fix_curly_quotes = TRUE, as_vector = TRUE)
Sentiment_score = c(Sentiment_score, sum(sentiment_by(sentence, by = NULL)$"ave_sentiment") / sum(song_2000_2010))
sentence = get_sentences(dt_lyrics$stemmedwords[song_2010_2020], fix_curly_quotes = TRUE, as_vector = TRUE)
Sentiment_score = c(Sentiment_score, sum(sentiment_by(sentence, by = NULL)$"ave_sentiment") / sum(song_2010_2020))

```
As the graph shown below, we found that 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 are transition point that attitude of lyrics become negative from positive. In general, the lyrics become negative in 2000-2010, and this situation fits our assumption in previous section. Thus, I would compare Sentiment Score with GDP Growth to prove my guess.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
Sentiment_score1 = 20 * Sentiment_score
year <- c("1970-1980","1980-1990", "1990-2000","2000-2010","2010-2020")
type1 <- rep('Sentiment',length(year))
type2 <- rep('GDP Growth',length(year))
Sentiment <- data.frame(year,Sentiment_score1,type1)
gdp_growth <- c(3.24,3.13,3.23,2.33,2.30)
GDP_growth <- data.frame(year,gdp_growth,type2)
colnames(Sentiment) <- c("Year","Value","Type")
colnames(GDP_growth) <- c("Year","Value","Type")
p <-ggplot(Sentiment, aes(Year, Value))
p +geom_bar(stat = "identity")+xlab("Years") + ylab("Sentiment")+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+ ggtitle("Song Sentiment in each time peroid")




```

In the graph of lyrics and GDP growth, we found that GDP growth and lyrics' sentiment have the same changing trend. When GDP Growth decreses, the sentiment of lyrics will also decrease. During 2000-2010, a lot of big events happened. 2000 internet bubble, 911, iraq war,2008 financial depression and so on happened in this peroid.The gdp growth also represents that these negative event really influence the economics while the lyrics sentiment becomes negative from positive. Thus, we can state that Sentiment of lyrics and GDP growth do have close relationship. Arts and music can reflect economic status. In history subject, experts usually use poems and articles to research the history as potential evidence, and song and music play the similar rols as poems and articles in current worlds. Thus, songs and lyrics can be a mearsurement to estimate the economic performance in real world. I will also check the covariance data to confirm this conclusion


```{r}
ggplot(rbind(Sentiment,GDP_growth), aes(x=Year, y=Value, col=Type,group=Type)) + geom_line()+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+ ggtitle("Song Sentiment And GDP Growth")
```
### Covariance berween GDP Growth and Song's Sentiment Score:
```{r}
cat("The correlation between GDP_Growth and Song's Sentiment: ", cor(Sentiment_score,gdp_growth))
```

## *Conclusion:*
- 1, Rock and POP are never out of date (for now)! Rock and POP are always the most popular songs' genre no matter in which time peroid. 
- 2, Jazz's position decreases through time passes, and more and more Hippop and metal song appeared. This can be the reason that young people prefer these types of music than Jazz.Also, different living pace in different time peroid can also decide people's preference of music. 
- 3, Sentiment and GDP Growth have really high relatioinship (Vocariance = 0.7762038). Economic performance of the sociaty really have influenced on lyrics' sentiment. This could be another potential arguement to measure the econmics status.
